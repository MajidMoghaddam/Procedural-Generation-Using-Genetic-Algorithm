# 🕹️ Procedural Level Generation Using Genetic Algorithm & Pygame

## 📖 Overview
This project generates **procedural game levels** using a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** 
and visualizes them using **Pygame**. The goal is to evolve a playable level that 
maximizes open spaces while ensuring **a path exists from start to goal**.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Genetic Algorithm for level optimization  
✅ BFS algorithm to check level validity  
✅ Pygame-based visualization  
✅ Auto-navigation using pathfinding  

## 🛠️ Installation
### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- DEAP (for Genetic Algorithm)
- NumPy

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install pygame deap numpy
